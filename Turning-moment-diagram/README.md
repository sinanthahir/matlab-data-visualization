## Turning Moment Diagram

The turning moment diagram a.k.a crank effort diagram is the graphical representation of the turning moment or cranck-effort for various positions of the crank.

- Q. The crank-pin cicle radius of a horizontal engine is 0.3m. The mass of the reciprocating parts is 250 kg. The net load acting on the piston is 68730 N. The connecting rod length between centers is 0.6m and if the engine runs at 250 r.p.m. Plot the turning moment diagram and find out the maximum torque.
